# Return-to-Oz

This is a game is based on he 1985 film "Return to Oz". There will be a home page with a picuture of a dilapidated Oz with head link to the next page.
The next page will have an image of the Gnome King and Dorothy with text instructions for how to play the game. In the text he will reveal that he has captured the scarecrow, tin man and lion. He has turned them into ornaments in his palace. Dorothy(the player) will have an opportunity to select from 9 objects. If she picks the correct 3 out of the 9 a message will show that she has rescued her friends and won the game. If she chooses incorrectly 4 times she looses her friends forever.
When she chooses correctly Scarecrow, Jack or Tik-Tok will appear. When she makes an incorrect choice the ornamnet will disappear. Each time the game is played the correct choices will be different.

This will be created with HTML5, CSS and Javascript.

Tne challenge will be making this look as good as it could.
I will start by just making a basic html page with 9 divs so I can create the function where the computer randomly selects the winning objects from an array.
Then add the events that will happen when the selections are made.
Lastly I will style it by adding a bunch images and background images to the game.

MVP
-Create a function which randomnly selects winning objects so the game will be different each timne.
-Create eventListeners that cause changes in the game when correct and incorrect selections are made.
-Create some type of score keeping function that will determin when the game is over.
-Create different endings for different scores.

Strech Goals
-Add some audio files when selections are made.
-Make the odds of winning a little easier as the odds of finding all 3 characters aren't in the players favor.
