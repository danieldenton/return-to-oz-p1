# Return-to-Oz

I would like to make a Return to Oz Game. There will be a home page with a picuture of a dilapidated Oz with head link to the next page. 
The next page will have an image of the Gnome King with text instructions for how to play the game. 
In the text he will reveal that he has captured the scarecrow, tin man and lion. He has turned them into objects in his palace. 
Dorothy(the player) will have an opportunity to select from 9 objects. If she picks the correct 3 out of the 9 a message will show that 
she has rescued her friends and won the game.  If she chooses incorrectly 3 times she losses her friends forever. 
When she chooses correctly the scraecrow, tin man or lion will appear. When she makes an incorrect choice the screen will flash with lightning. 
Each time the game is played the correct choices will be different.
objects: 
1. cadelabra
2. chair
3. crystal ball
4. book
5. doll
6. figurine
7. crystal
8. wine glass
9. bust statue

Tne challenge will be making this look as good as it could. 
I will start by just making a basic html page with 9 divs so I can create the function where the computer randomly selects the winning objects from an array.
Then add the events that will happen when the selections are made. 
Lastly I will style it by adding a bunch images and background images to the game.
